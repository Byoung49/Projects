# Projects
**Starting out with Python projects**

Here is a collection of some small projects i have created while completing the HyperionDev
Data Science/ML Bootcamp. 

# Finance Calculator - 
in this Project i created a calculator that takes user input to work
figures out for both general investments, and house purchase investments / bond payments.
This Calculator when selecting investment will work out the accrued interest for either simple
or compound interest. when working out a bond payment, The calculator takes the initial value of
the property, the interest rate and the duration (in months) in which the user desires to pay 
back the loan, the program then outputs the correct monthly payment dependent on user input. 

# Simple_Chatbot -
[Case Study Story] --> Imagine the first day of university for a freshman named Alex. 
Alex is excited but also overwhelmed by the vast campus, numerous courses, and the sea of new faces. 
To aid new students like Alex, the university's IT department has developed a personalised chatbot. 
This chatbot, named "UniBuddy", is designed to make the transition smoother for freshmen.
Upon accessing the chatbot, Alex is prompted to enter their name, favourite colour, and age. 
Based on this input, UniBuddy offers a personalised greeting.
For instance, if Alex's favourite colour is blue,
    UniBuddy might suggest joining the university's "Blue Art Club".
If Alex is 18, the chatbot might provide information about freshman-specific events.
The chatbot also offers a feature where Alex can input specific queries, like "Where is the library?"
    or "How do I join the debate club?", 
        and UniBuddy responds with relevant information, all while adhering to a friendly tone,
        using string transformation methods to ensure the responses feel personalised and engaging.

# Text Based Slot Machine
in this project i have focussed on using as many of the fundemetal skills within python as possible 
in order to create a simple text based slot machine. the user inputs a deposit amount and bets a user
defined amount on 1, 2 or 3 lines.
the output then tracks winnings, money bet, and total money left over. if the user is to quit the game
then the user will be shown the amount that they left the game with.
